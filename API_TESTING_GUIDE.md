## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "SyntaxError: Unexpected token" for `/Hubot/kb`

**Problem:** You're sending JSON when the endpoint expects plain text.

**Solution:** 
- In Postman, select "raw" body type
- Choose "Text" from the dropdown (NOT JSON)
- Remove any JSON formatting like quotes or braces
- Send plain text directly

### Issue 2: "MulterError: Unexpected field" for file uploads

**Problem:** Wrong field name or form-data setup.

**Solution:**
- In Postman, select "form-data" body type
- Use exactly `file` as the key name
- Change the key type to "File" (click dropdown next to key field)
- Make sure you're uploading a .txt file

### Issue 3: 400 Bad Request for file uploads

**Problem:** File is not a .txt file or no file selected.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your file has a .txt extension
- Make sure the file is actually selected in Postman
- The API only accepts .txt files

### Issue 4: Server not responding

**Problem:** Server might not be running.

**Solution:**
- Run `node index.js` to start the server
- Check that you see "âœ… Server running at http://localhost:8080"
- Ensure no other process is using port 8080

## Testing Flow

1. Start with `GET /Hubot/show-kb` to see current (empty) knowledge base
2. Use `POST /Hubot/kb` to set initial content
3. Use `GET /Hubot/show-kb` to verify content was set
4. Use `POST /Hubot/add-kb` to append more content
5. Use `GET /Hubot/show-kb` to see combined content
6. Test file uploads with `POST /Hubot/kb-upload` and `POST /Hubot/add-kb-upload`
7. Test the message endpoint with `POST /Hubot/message`

## File Requirements

- Only .txt files are accepted for uploads
- Files are temporarily stored in `uploads/` directory and deleted after processing
- Maximum file size depends on your system's available memory

## Response Format

All successful responses return JSON with:
- `message`: Description of the action performed
- `status`: Always "success" for successful operations
- `knowledgeBase`: Current KB content (only for show-kb endpoint)

All error responses return JSON with:
- `error`: Description of what went wrong
